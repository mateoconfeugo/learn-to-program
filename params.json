Then copying the test into a test suite file and evaluating that.\r\nFurther since the lein autoexpect plugin is continuous running your test it will pick up the change and run it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2014 Matt Burns All rights reserved\r\n\r\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.\r\n","google":"UA-67852560-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
